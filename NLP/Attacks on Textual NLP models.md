### 🌟 **Adversarial Attacks in** 🖼 **Computer Vision (CV)** & 📝 **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**  

Adversarial attacks in **Computer Vision (CV)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** share some similarities but also have significant differences due to the nature of the data and models involved. Below is a detailed comparison of adversarial attacks in both fields:

---

## 🎯 **1. Nature of Data**
### 🖼 **Computer Vision:**
- **📊 Data Type:** Images (pixel values).  
- **🗺 Structure:** Grid-like structure with spatial relationships.  
- **🎭 Perturbations:** Small changes to pixel values (e.g., adding noise) can be imperceptible to humans but significantly affect model predictions.  

### 📝 **NLP:**
- **📜 Data Type:** Text (words, characters, or subwords).  
- **🔗 Structure:** Sequential and discrete (words are not continuous like pixels).  
- **📝 Perturbations:** Small changes like swapping words, adding typos, or inserting adversarial tokens. These changes must preserve grammatical correctness and semantic meaning.

## ⚔️ **2. Types of Adversarial Attacks**
### 🖼 **Computer Vision:**
1. 🏳 **White-Box Attacks:**  
   - Full access to the model (architecture, weights, etc.).  
   - Examples: ⚡ **FGSM (Fast Gradient Sign Method)**, 🎯 **PGD (Projected Gradient Descent)**.  
2. 🕵 **Black-Box Attacks:**  
   - No access to the model but can query it.  
   - Examples: 🔄 **Transferability attacks**, ❌ **Decision-based attacks**.  
3. 🎭 **Physical Attacks:**  
   - Applied to physical objects (e.g., adversarial patches on stop signs).  
   - Examples: 🏷 **Adversarial stickers**, 🎨 **Patches**.  
4. 🌐 **Universal Attacks:**  
   - A single perturbation that fools the model on multiple inputs.  
   - Example: 🌊 **Universal adversarial perturbations**.  

### 📝 **NLP:**
1. 🏳 **White-Box Attacks:**  
   - Full access to the model.  
   - Example: 🔥 **HotFlip** (Gradient-based attack).  
2. 🕵 **Black-Box Attacks:**  
   - No model access but can query it.  
   - Examples: 🏴 **TextFooler**, 🤖 **BERT-Attack**.  
3. 🔡 **Character-Level Attacks:**  
   - Small modifications at the character level (e.g., typos, swaps).  
   - Example: 🐞 **DeepWordBug**.  
4. 📖 **Word-Level Attacks:**  
   - Word replacements (e.g., synonyms).  
   - Example: 🏴 **TextFooler**.  
5. 🏛 **Sentence-Level Attacks:**  
   - Adding or modifying entire sentences.  
   - Example: 📝 **Adversarial prompts in text generation models**.
