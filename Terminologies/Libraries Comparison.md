Both tensorflow,pytorch (deeplearning frameworks ) uses these libraries


 1. Keras

    Purpose: Deep learning library.
    Use Cases:
        Building and training neural networks.
        Tasks involving image recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and generative models.
        Used for complex deep learning architectures like CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks), RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks), transformers, etc.
    Features:
        High-level API for TensorFlow, enabling quick prototyping of models.
        Simplifies defining and training deep learning models.
        Includes support for GPU acceleration for faster training.





2. Scikit-learn

     Purpose: Machine learning library for classical algorithms.
    Use Cases:
        Preprocessing data (e.g., scaling, encoding, splitting).
        Training models for regression, classification, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.
        Evaluating models with metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
        Hyperparameter tuning with grid search or random search.
    Features:
        Includes many machine learning algorithms (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, SVMs).
        Focuses on simpler models compared to deep learning.
        Provides extensive tools for data preprocessing and evaluation.


3. Pandas

    Purpose: Data manipulation and analysis library.
    Use Cases:
        Loading, cleaning, and transforming datasets (e.g., CSV, Excel, SQL).
        Handling missing values, filtering, and aggregation.
        Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA).
        Preparing data for use in Scikit-learn or Keras.
    Features:
        Works with tabular data using DataFrames and Series.
        Supports various file formats for input/output.
        Integrates well with other libraries like Matplotlib and NumPy.
